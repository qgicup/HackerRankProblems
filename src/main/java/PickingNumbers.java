/**
 * Given an array of integers, find and print the maximum number of integers you can select from the array such that the absolute difference between any two of the chosen integers is less than or equal to . For example, if your array is , you can create two subarrays meeting the criterion:  and . The maximum length subarray has  elements.
 *
 * Input Format
 *
 * The first line contains a single integer , the size of the array .
 * The second line contains  space-separated integers .
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 * The answer will be .
 * Output Format
 *
 * A single integer denoting the maximum number of integers you can choose from the array such that the absolute difference between any two of the chosen integers is .
 *
 * Sample Input 0
 *
 * 6
 * 4 6 5 3 3 1
 * Sample Output 0
 *
 * 3
 * Explanation 0
 *
 * We choose the following multiset of integers from the array: . Each pair in the multiset has an absolute difference  (i.e.,  and ), so we print the number of chosen integers, , as our answer.
 *
 * Sample Input 1
 *
 * 6
 * 1 2 2 3 1 2
 * Sample Output 1
 *
 * 5
 * Explanation 1
 *
 * We choose the following multiset of integers from the array: . Each pair in the multiset has an absolute difference  (i.e., , , and ), so we print the number of chosen integers, , as our answer.

        // e.g
        // HashMap -> { 1:20, 6:30, 3:70}

        // Array -> [_, 20, _, 70, _, _, 30] -> the frequencies of the array, stored in the array at the position of the key value <3 <3 <3
        //           0   1  2  3   4  5   6  -> the index of the array, in this case used as substitute for the values above.
        // By using the array as a HashMap, with the key's being the indexes of the array, then we get a nicely sorted HashMap <3 <3 <3
        // which can be used in several cases. Of course, the array is not completely filled -> the key's are a bit sparse, and they must keep their index (since that represents the value)
        // but thought, you can still use them in a nicely sorted order (e.g if you iterate it in any way).

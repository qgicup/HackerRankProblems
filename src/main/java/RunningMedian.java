/**
 * The median of a dataset of integers is the midpoint value of the dataset for which an equal number of integers are less than and greater than the value. To find the median, you must first sort your dataset of integers in non-decreasing order, then:
 * <p>
 * If your dataset contains an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element of the sorted sample. In the sorted dataset ,  is the median.
 * If your dataset contains an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements of the sorted sample. In the sorted dataset ,  is the median.
 * Given an input stream of  integers, you must perform the following task for each  integer:
 * <p>
 * Add the  integer to a running list of integers.
 * Find the median of the updated list (i.e., for the first element through the  element).
 * Print the list's updated median on a new line. The printed value must be a double-precision number scaled to  decimal place (i.e.,  format).
 * Input Format
 * <p>
 * The first line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of integers in the data stream.
 * Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains an integer, , to be added to your list.
 * <p>
 * Constraints
 * <p>
 * Output Format
 * <p>
 * After each new integer is added to the list, print the list's updated median on a new line as a single double-precision number scaled to  decimal place (i.e.,  format).

     * Will get the median of the array, based on the left and right heaps.
     * In case array it's even : take the median of the smallest/biggest number
     * In case array it's odd : take the element on the middle of the array
     *
     * Solution :
     *  1) use insertion sort to sort the array, and take the elements in the middle always -> O(n^2)
     *  2) Use BST Balanced, and take the root element, which should be the middle usually.
     *     If it's evenly balanced (left == right), take left root and right root and make the median
     *     It can work, but it's not so efficient, due frequent rebalancing
     *  3) Use 1 MinHeap and 1 MaxHeap to keep the minimums and maximum.
     *     it will also serve to keep the elements in the middle of the array as the roots of these 2 heaps.
     *     For that its important to insert an evne number of elements in both heaps.
     *     If one becomes unbalanced, take items from there and move it in the second heap.
     *     At most, there should be only 1 in difference between the heaps.
     *     This way, we can consider that the root of the 2 heaps, are the elements in the middle
     *     of the array actually.
     *
     * We can use a max heap on left side to represent elements that are less than effective median,
     * and a min heap on right side to represent elements that are greater than effective median.
     * After processing an incoming element, the number of elements in heaps
     * differ utmost by 1 element. When both heaps contain same number of elements,
     * we pick average of heaps root data as effective median.
     * When the heaps are not balanced, we select effective median from the root
     * of heap containing more elements.
     *
     * ! IMPORTANT ! We always want the median, and the best way to accomplish that, is to always
     * store the minimum and the maximum, and then do the median compared on them.
     * We can easily accomplish storing minimum/maximum by having 2 heaps.
     *
     * Those heaps is important to be balanced, aka contain the same number of elements,
     * so then we have a good basis where to insert the new element.
     *
     * Insert procedure :
     *
     *      check if trees are balanced :
     *      leftTree > rightTree :
     *          compare newElem with oldMedian and
     *              - insert in leftTree if less  (also make sure elements are shifted to the other tree, so they will be balanced)
     *              - insert in rightTree if bigger
     *              - take the average of the left & right peek
     *      leftTree == rightTree :
     *          compare newElem with oldMedian and
     *              - insert in leftTree if less, take leftTree peak
     *              - insert in rightTree if bigger, take rightTree peak
     *
     *      leftTree < rightTree :
     *          compare newElem with oldMedian and
     *              - insert in leftTree if less  (also make sure elements are shifted to the other tree, so they will be balanced)
     *              - insert in rightTree if bigger
     *              - take the average of the left & right peek

/**
 *
 * A gene is represented as a string of length  (where  is divisible by ), composed of the letters , , , and . It is considered to be steady if each of the four letters occurs exactly  times. For example,  and  are both steady genes.
 *
 * Bear Limak is a famous biotechnology scientist who specializes in modifying bear DNA to make it steady. Right now, he is examining a gene represented as a string . It is not necessarily steady. Fortunately, Limak can choose one (maybe empty) substring of  and replace it with any string of the same length.
 *
 * Modifying a large substring of bear genes can be dangerous. Given a string , can you help Limak find the length of the smallest possible substring that he can replace to make  a steady gene?
 *
 * Note: A substring of a string  is a subsequence made up of zero or more contiguous characters of .
 *
 * Input Format
 *
 * The first line contains an interger  divisible by , denoting the length of a string .
 * The second line contains a string  of length .
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 *  is divisible by
 * Subtask
 *
 *  in tests worth  points.
 * Output Format
 *
 * Print the length of the minimum length substring that can be replaced to make  stable.
 *
 * Sample Input
 *
 * 8
 * GAAATAAA
 * Sample Output
 *
 * 5
 * Explanation
 *
 * One optimal solution is to replace  with  resulting in .

    /**
     * This function will try to make a gene stable. In order for a gene to be stable, it needs that each 4 characters of it,
     * to occur at maximum n/4 times.
     *
     * A gene is represented as a string of length n (where n is divisible by 4), composed of the letters A, C, T, and G.
     * It is considered to be steady if each of the four letters occurs exactly n/4 times. For example, GACT and GACTGACT are both steady genes.
     *
     * E.g GAAATAAA -> 5 minimal changes. If we replace AAATA with TTCCG -> GTTCCGAA
     *
     * Facts :
     *  - we need to find n. We are supposed to replace strings, not to add or remove them, hence n is stable.
     *  - as soon as we know n, we can compute the frequency of the letters.
     *  - n/4 will tell us how many characters are missing from the gene in order to be steady.
     *
     *  We need to find the smallest substring that has to be replaced, in order to make the gene steady. Which means the characters have to be continous.
     *
     *  Possible solution :
     *
     *  1) calculate n
     *  E.g for GAAATAAA -> n = 8, -> noCharacters = 8/4 = 2;
     *
     *  2) calculate frequency
     *  freq[G = 1, A = 6, T =1, C = 0]
     *
     *  3) analyze frequency needs -> freqComplement [G = +1, A = -4, T = +1, C = +2]
     *
     *  4) Do dynamic programming from the end of the array.
     *
     *  Let s be a string, and i be it's index.
     *
     *  SCS(s) = { 0,                           if i == 0 }
     *           { SCS(s[i-1]) + 1,             if s[i-1] belongs to freqComplement  }
     *           { min(result, SCS(s[i]),       if freqComplement is empty }
     *           { 0,                           if s[i-1] does not belong to freqComplement }
     *
     *
     *  E.g GAAATAAA
     *  i = n = 7, freqComplement [G = +1, A = -4, T = +1, C = +2]  -> GTCC -> 4 max sum.
     *  Now we need to find a subsequence of 4 characters that needs to be replaced with this one (GTCC)
     *  We need to find a subsequence of length 4, with the following characters [AAAA]
     *
     *  GAAATAAA -> GAAATAAA
     *
     *
     *  This is genius, so short, so efficient code. Two points technique.
     *  The right point is sliding from 0 to n-1 of s chars,
     *  until there is steady rest of the string by the right side of the right point.
     *
     *  Then left point slides from 0 until it's steady all the string which is
     *  by the left side of the left point. On each step of the left point the
     *  length between points counted and stored the min one. Loop continues until
     *  right point reaches n-1 of s chars. Steadyness controlled using counting
     *  sort technique (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/countingsort1) which
     *  is implemented not with the array, but with the HashMap.
